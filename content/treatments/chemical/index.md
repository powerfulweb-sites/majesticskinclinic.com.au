Chemical peels, also called chemexfoliation or derma-peeling treatments, are cosmetic treatments performed on the face, typically used as an anti-aging solution to rejuvenate the skin. Chemical peels are used to correct skin irregularities in texture, such as fine lines, and color, such as spots caused by sun damage. These peels have varying strengths, characterized by the different kinds of acids used in the applied chemical solution. Chemical-peel solutions use three main acid ingredients to reach varying levels of intensity: alphahydroxy acid (AHA), trichloroacetic acid (TCA), and phenol.
