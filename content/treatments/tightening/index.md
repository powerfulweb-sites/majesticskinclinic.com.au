  The heat injected causes the collagen to contract which induces growth factors and stimulates new collagen synthesis, replacing the old collagen with new fibres that are more compact and organised, to give a less wrinkled appearance. This treatment is quick, comfortable and non-invasive with minimal downtime. Results are seen 3 months post treatments.

Here at Majestic skin clinic we specialise and provide medical grade skin treatments that treat ageing skin and provide a long -lasting tightening effect which delivers a lift & brightens the skin.

Our specialised skin tightening treatment is designed to stimulate dermal collagen production and help with the regeneration of damaged skin cells. Using our Candela GentleYAG Laser Technology, the heat energy injected into the skin penetrates deep whilst protecting the visible and upper layers, so as not to damage the skin.
