  Laser therapy provides a fast and effective way to reduce and remove vascular veins on various areas of the body.
  The laser penetrates to the depth of the target blood vessel, whilst the laser’s energy selectively destroys the blood cells within the blood vessel with no damage to the surrounding tissue. This allows for selective destruction of superficial vascular lesions with minimal downtime. Your body will naturally remove the capillary vessel via the lymphatic system.
