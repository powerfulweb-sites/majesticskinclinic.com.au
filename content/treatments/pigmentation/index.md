  **How laser Pigmentation Removal works:**


  Laser Pigmentation Removal is safe and effective to reduce the appearance of freckles, pigmentation and age spots. The laser targets only the pigmented lesion in the skin which absorbs the light, without damaging the surrounding tissue. The laser shatters the pigment.

  The pigmented lesions on the surface will dry and flake off the treated area.


  **Aftercare:**

  * Avoid sun exposure and use of our skincare at home and SPF 50+

  * Avoid laser and skin treatments on the area

  * Avoid fake tan, solarium, tanning drugs

  * Avoid Vitamin A 2weeks before

  Laser Pigment Reduction

  * Suitable for age spots and freckles

  * Reverses the signs of sun damage and ageing


  **Is there any down time?**


  No, however, immediately after treatment the treated area will become slightly darker and must be covered with sunscreen.


  **How many treatments are needed?**


  While some may love results from just one session, 3 sessions are ideal for the best results. You may require additional sessions depending on the level of pigmentation.

Target superficial pigment & dermal pigment.

The second and lower layer of skin, called our dermis, is responsible for giving us our pigment called melanin when over stimulated, can cause excess pigmentation.
The over stimulation of melanin can be caused by excess sun exposure or hormonal changes and certain medications. This is the brown discolouration some see on the cheeks, chin, forehead and upper lip.
Mainly appears on women but can also appear in men.

Sun exposure is the number one cause of pigmentation, as it’s sunlight that triggers the production of melanin in the first place. Melanin acts as your skin’s natural sunscreen by protecting you from harmful UV rays, which is why people tan in the sun.
But excessive sun exposure can disrupt this process, leading to hyperpigmentation.

Here at Majestic Skin clinic we offer several solutions that can improve and rejuvenate the skin. We target supreficial pigment and dermal pigment whilst reversing the signs of sun damage and ageing.
